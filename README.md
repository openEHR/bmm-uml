bmm-uml
=======
UML to BMM converter
This is an Extension/Add-in on the Sparx Enterprise Architect UML Tool that takes any UML model and serializes it as a BMM file suitable as config file for the OpenEHR ADL Workbench.

We used it for the CIMI mini Reference Model and experimented with the BRIDG models.

This is as-is software for now and needs documentation.

Future plans include aligning with OMG AML Specification <http://www.omg.org/spec/AML>, specifically the AML Reference Model Profile.
